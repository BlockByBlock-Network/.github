# Block By Block

**Fixing fake engagement in Web3.**  
Projects waste money on bots. We build a system where **only verified humans earn rewards** — creating real, lasting communities.  
Authenticity becomes the new growth engine.

---

### The Problem  
Most Web3 communities vanish when rewards stop.  
Budgets go to bots, not people. Engagement isn’t real.

### The Solution  
Block by Block turns contribution into proof.  
Verified users complete quests, earn XP, NFTs, and tokens.  
Projects pay only for genuine participation.

---

### Roadmap  
**Foundation → MVP → Expansion → Scale**  
Build → Test → Partner → Grow.

---

### Vision  
The quest layer of Web3 — where participation equals value.

### Mission  
Reward real people for real impact, block by block.
